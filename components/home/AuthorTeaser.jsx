            Born and raised mostly in Toronto, Canada, Michael J Dooley
            graduated from high school, then took courses at Humber College in
            computer sciences, followed by attending Ryerson Polytechnic, where
            he learned photography and digital arts. He spent twelve years as a
            professional photographer in Peterborough, Ontario, then moved to
            Orangeville, where he retired and now spends his time writing
            adventure fantasy stories that were intended for children and teens,
            but he found people of all ages all over the world were enjoying his
            magical tales of fantasy and adventures. His inspirations to tell
            these tales all come from his life experiences as he grew up, plus
            his imagination and desire to create worlds that he wished were real
            but only possible in his fictional novels.
